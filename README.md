My bucket list
==============

A list (in no particular order) of things I'd like to achieve or experience before I die. This list is by no means exhaustive, and will be revised and added to over time. 

Pull requests considered, thoroughly, then most likely rejected.

(hat-tip to [Techwraith](https://github.com/Techwraith) for the idea)

## The List

- [ ] Work as a CTO / CxO (probably not CEO as I'd fail with that level of responsibility across an org)
- [ ] Give a TED talk.
- [ ] Write a book.
= [ ] Get a [small tattoo](https://twitter.com/andypiper/status/1148707820965175296)
- [ ] Visit the [LEGO House](https://www.legohouse.com/en-gb).
- [ ] Learn to play an instrument.
- [ ] Have a child.
